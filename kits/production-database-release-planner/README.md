# AI Database Release Planner

## Overview

AI Database Release Planner is a multi-agent AI system built with Lamatic AgentKit for analyzing SQL database migrations and producing a final release report.

The project is designed to help teams review database changes before release, with a focus on understanding the migration, assessing runtime behavior, choosing a deployment strategy, and deciding whether the release should proceed.

## Problem Statement

SQL migration scripts can be difficult to evaluate quickly and consistently, especially when a release may affect production availability, locking behavior, rollback complexity, or data safety.

This project organizes that review into a structured agent pipeline so the migration can be analyzed step by step before a release decision is made.

## Features

- Migration Understanding Agent for SQL schema analysis.
- Behavior Analysis Agent for PostgreSQL runtime behavior assessment.
- Deployment Strategy Agent for release planning recommendations.
- Release Decision Agent for approval and rollback guidance.
- Structured JSON contracts between every pipeline stage.
- Multi-agent workflow built with Lamatic AgentKit.

## Architecture

The project is implemented as a Lamatic AgentKit workflow with a clear, sequential agent chain.

The system follows a sequential multi-agent architecture where each agent performs a single responsibility and appends its analysis to a structured JSON output. This separation of concerns improves maintainability, traceability, and extensibility.

Each agent receives the previous agent's JSON output, appends its own analysis, and passes the enriched result to the next stage.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm.
- A Lamatic project with the `release-safety-pipeline` flow deployed (see [`agent.md`](agent.md) for the expected flow contract).

### Steps

1. From the repository root, move into the app directory:
   ```bash
   cd kits/production-database-release-planner/apps
   ```
2. Copy the environment template and fill in your Lamatic project values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Set `LAMATIC_API_URL`, `LAMATIC_PROJECT_ID`, `LAMATIC_API_KEY`, and `LAMATIC_FLOW_ID` in `.env.local` (see `.env.example` for details on each variable).
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
4. Run the app in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), paste or select a preset SQL migration, and run the pipeline.

## Example Workflow

1. Provide an SQL migration input file in examples/input/.
2. Run the migration through the agent pipeline.
3. Review the generated outputs and release recommendation.
4. Compare the result with the reference output in examples/expected-output/.

## Future Work

- Support additional database engines beyond PostgreSQL.
- Expand migration pattern coverage.
- Improve agent evaluation accuracy.
- Add automated schema validation.
- Introduce policy-based release approval.
- Support additional database engines (MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server).
- Integrate automated migration validation and policy enforcement.
